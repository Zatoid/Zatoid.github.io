Hello, my name is Zachary Gomez and this is my new blog titled "The Serpents Crown". A little about myself, I am a big nerd when it comes to technology and gaming, as well as an avid enthusiast when it comes to writing. I have always wanted to start a blog but never knew where to begin.

With that, this blog will focus on multiple topics. The primary topic will focus on documenting my learning journey through tech. The secondary topic will focus on my personal opinions around the gaming industry and the impact that writing has on any particular games success. It is a bit of a mixed bag, however, I believe showcasing my passion and competence in these areas will help me grow and provide an interesting perspective for others, while also maintaining a sense of professionalism and quality.

The name "Serpents Crown" was something I created a few years back. The Serpent is representative of the programming language "*Python*" and the Crown is a metaphor referring to the many hats a hacker can wear relative to a cybersecurity perspective.

The hats are categorized by color such as; white hat, grey hat, blue hat, and black hat. White hats are hackers who are hired to hack into your system legally, and black hats are malicious actors who only seek to harm others. It is a fairly loaded and long-winded metaphor of a name, but I like it. I have always been a fan of eccentric and wild ideas especially when it comes to storytelling and imagination.

I relate to the name because I have personally struggled in finding what hat I wish to wear in life. So, I have decided to wear the hat of the student; one who wishes to learn and expand his "*language*", so to speak, and share his ideas with whomever chooses to listen. I am excited to delve into what makes me tick and to hopefully learn alongside you. Thank you and welcome to The Serpents Crown.
